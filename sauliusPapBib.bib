abstract = {With hundreds of thousands of mobile applications available today, your app has to capture users immediately. This book provides practical techniques to help you catch---and keep---their attention. You'll learn core principles for designing effective user interfaces, along with a set of common patterns for interaction design on all types of mobile devices. Mobile design specialists Steven Hoober and Eric Berkman have collected and researched 76 best practices for everything from composing pages and displaying information to the use of screens, lights, and sensors. Each pattern includes a discussion of the design problem and solution, along with variations, interaction and presentation details, and antipatterns. Compose pages so that information is easy to locate and manipulate Provide labels and visual cues appropriate for your app's users Use information control widgets to help users quickly access details Take advantage of gestures and other sensors Apply specialized methods to prevent errors and the loss of user-entered data Enable users to easily make selections, enter text, and manipulate controls Use screens, lights, haptics, and sounds to communicate your message and increase user satisfaction "Designing Mobile Interfaces is another stellar addition to O'Reilly's essential interface books. Every mobile designer will want to have this thorough book on their shelf for reference." ---Dan Saffer, Author of Designing Gestural Interfaces},

abstract = {We present a menu interface designed primarily for head-worn displays that have a small field-of-view. To support interaction with a hierarchical menu, we logically divide an absolute positioning device into finger-operated strip segments, which we use as one-dimensional scrolling devices. Our menu system is intended to make user interaction faster by not requiring constant visual feedback. This is preferable for interaction in which the visual user interface elements occupy only a small portion of the eye's entire field-of-view and in which navigating in menus with a pointer would be awkward and time-consuming. With our approach, it is even possible for the user to use peripheral vision for interaction, since there is no need to precisely position a small pointer on the screen. Thus, the user can maintain eye contact with others or keep his or her focus of attention on the environment while using a wearable device. View full abstract},

abstract = {A thorough introduction to the development and applications of intelligent wearable interfaces As mobile computing, sensing technology, and artificial intelligence become more advanced and their applications more widespread, the area of intelligent wearable interfaces is growing in importance. This emerging form of human-machine interaction has infinite possibilities for enhancing humans' capabilities in communications, actions, monitoring, and control. Intelligent Wearable Interfaces is a collection of the efforts the authors have made in this area at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. They introduce methodologies to develop a variety of intelligent wearable interfaces and cover practical implementations of systems for real-life applications. A number of novel intelligent wearable interface systems are examined, including: Network architecture for wearable robots Wearable interface for automatic language translation Intelligent cap interface for wheelchair control Intelligent shoes for human-computer interface Fingertip human-computer interface Ubiquitous 3D digital writing instrument Intelligent mobile human airbag system This book is a valuable reference for researchers, designers, engineers, and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of human-machine interactions,rehabilitation engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence.},
